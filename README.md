## ü§ñ GelatoBot solution limitations and possible improvements:

- In the sample conversations provided, On asking bot about order status, the bot directly responded back with order details. A           customer can have multiple simultaneous pending orders. Ideally the bot should ask about the customer order id or some reference       number before sharing details. Though I already made this change.
- Customer specific session management.
- Can share order images along with the details. If already dispatched, can fetch and share current location of the order from the       logistics partner.
- Possiblity of order cancelling or address change or delivery instructions.
